Welcome to my snake online game!

# About

Hey, I'm lilrollieguy. I am a coder who codes for fun. This project was my attempt at learning django and pygame, which the snake game was originally programmed in. I am also a Minecraft modder, you can find me on Curseforge or Modrinth. I also sporadically code on scratch. Anyway, I hope you enjoy my game!

# How to play
Welcome to Snake Online. An online snake game built by me! In canse you have never played snake before, here's how you do it. So you are the little snake on the screen, and you can control which direction he goes by using WASD or the arrow keys. Your goal is to eat every apple without running into yourself or the wall. When you eat an apple, your snake will grow and the game will go faster. You also have a timer that you can try to minimize. You can pause using P or ESC, but it will still run down the timer! Try to get the highest score. If you get a new highscore, it will ask you for your name, and you will appear on the highscore table. Good luck, and have fun.
